Balance Beam is a website and mobile app designed to guide users toward a healthier lifestyle by personalizing their journey to physical and mental well-being.

Our mission is to empower users with tailored food recommendations, curated training programs, and interactive tools to track their fitness progress. Using advanced 3D modeling, Balance Beam provides a detailed visualization of targeted muscles and their intensity levels during workouts.

To support mental health, Balance Beam features an AI-powered therapist for instant guidance and emotional support. Additionally, users can book online meetings with nutritionists, fitness coaches, or therapists, enabling them to receive expert advice and personalized care at their convenience.

At Balance Beam, we strive to harmonize physical and mental wellness, making it accessible, personalized, and engaging for everyone.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want to input my dietary preferences and health data, so that I can check whether specific ingredients are healthy for me based on the information I provided.
- As a fitness enthusiast, I want to view a 3D model of my body after a workout, so that I can see which muscles I targeted and how intensely they were engaged.

- As a user seeking professional advice, I want to schedule an online meeting with a nutritionist, coach, or therapist, so that I can receive personalized guidance to improve my health and well-being.

###  Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [React and React Native development frameworks](https://react.dev/). React is a powerful library for building user interfaces on the web, while React Native extends its capabilities to mobile app development. Together, they allow us to use a single codebase for apps across web and mobile platforms.

- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.

- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
